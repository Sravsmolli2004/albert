<strong><h3>**Early Life and Education**</h3></strong><br>
<i>Albert Einstein was born on <mark>March 14, 1879, in Ulm,</mark>,in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg in the German Empire.<br> 
He grew up in a secular <sub>Jewish family</sub> and showed an early interest in science and mathematics.<br>
 In 1896, he enrolled in the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, where he earned his diploma in 1900.<br>
<b><h3>**Early Career and Annus Mirabilis**</h3></b><br>
After graduation, Einstein worked at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, which gave him the time to conduct research.<br>
 In 1905, often referred to as his <mark>"annus mirabilis" or "miracle year",</mark> Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.<br>
  These papers covered the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and mass-energy equivalence <sup>  (E=mc^2)</sup>.<br> 
  These works laid the foundation for modern physics and established Einstein as a leading physicist.<br>

<b><h3>**Academic Career and General Relativity**</h3></b><br>
In 1915, Einstein completed his theory of general relativity, which revolutionized the understanding of gravity.<br> 
This theory was confirmed in 1919 when observations <mark>during a solar eclipse showed light bending around the sun</mark>, consistent with Einstein's predictions. <br>
Einstein became an international celebrity and a symbol of scientific genius.<br>

<b><h3>**Later Years and Legacy**</h3></b><br>
Einstein emigrated to the United States in 1933, escaping the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany.<br> 
He took a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he remained until his death.<br> 
Although he contributed to the development of quantum theory, Einstein famously disagreed with the interpretation of quantum mechanics, encapsulated in his statement, <mark>"God does not play dice with the universe."</mark><br>
Albert Einstein passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton. His contributions to physics, including his theories of relativity, have had a profound and lasting impact on the field.<br>
 Einstein's name has become synonymous with genius, and his legacy continues to influence scientific thought and popular culture.<br>

<b><h3>**Notable Achievements:**</h3><br></b>
 **1905**: Annus Mirabilis papers, including E=mc^2.<br>
 **1915**: General Theory of Relativity.<br>
 **1921**: Nobel Prize in Physics for the photoelectric effect.<br>
 **1933**: Emigration to the United States.<br>
 **1955**: Death in Princeton, New Jersey.<br>

Einstein's work transcended the realm of physics, touching on philosophy, politics, and humanitarian efforts, solidifying his place as one of the most influential figures of the 20th century.
